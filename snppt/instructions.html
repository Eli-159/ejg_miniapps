        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>The SNPPT App runs mostly online, but it is helpful if you have a few bookmarks set. (This works best in Chrome or Edge)</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Open your browser. Make sure your Bookmarks Bar is open. In Chrome, this can be toggled using Ctrl+Shift+B. 
                To do this is Edge, you will need to click on the star icon with three lines through it at the top of the screen, 
                click on the three dots in the window that appears and then select 'Show Bookmarks Bar'. Alternativly in Edge, 
                you can just click on the star icon with three lines through it each time.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Create a folder in your bookmarks bar called 'Notices'. 
                This can be done by right-clicking your bookmarks bar and selecting 'Add Folder'.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add a bookmark to this folder called 'Student Notices'. 
                In Chrome, this can be done by right clicking on the folder icon of your folder and selecting 'Add Page'. 
                If you are using Edge, you will need to go to the Bookmarks Menu, (the star icon with three lines through it) 
                add the current tab as a bookmark and then right click on it, select edit, and update the name and url.
                Enter the following url where asked:
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="urlBox">
                    <p>https://qedu.sharepoint.com/sites/1668/Student/Lists/StudentNotices/Current_Notices.aspx?viewid=84ba931b%2D859d%2D4f84%2D8a32%2De48db687cd77</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Add a second bookmark called 'Copy Notices'. This time, add the following code to the url box.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="urlBox">
                    <p><span id="bookmarkletCode"></span></p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Finally, add one last bookmark called 'SNPPT App' with the following url.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="urlBox">
                    <p>https://ejg-miniapps-svb26.ondigitalocean.app/snppt/home.html?#</p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Copying the Data</h2>

            <br>
            <li>Once this page has loaded, click the bookmark saved as 'Copy Notices'. If it is successful, it will display a message saying so and you can proceed. Otherwise, reload the page and try again.</li>
